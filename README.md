# Auto-Playlists

One of the main things I noticed as soon as I switched from Apple Music to Spotify was how much superior Spotify's music recommendation engine was in comparison to Apple's. From curated "Discover Weekly" playlists to "Recommended Songs" for a particular playlist, I was intrigued by the amount of thought that went in to creating such an accurate model.

I figured why not take a shot at creating my own recommendations using Spotify's Spoitpy API. What started as a simple curiosity project soon allowed me to discover many insights into my music taste.
